This mod allows `Ender Pearl` entity to selectively load chunks, so your `Ender Pearl` won't disappear in unloaded areas! 

**PearlTickets** serves as a replacement for nether portal chunk loading in Minecraft 1.14+, surpassing railway chunk loading in earlier versions. It should be beneficial when using a pearl cannon in 1.14+.
